Random Compat
=============

## What is this library?

This is a proof-of-concept (and potentially a compatibility library) for a simplified random number generation API to be proposed for PHP core for 5.6.

This library can generate strong random numbers and cryptographically secure random numbers.

## Usage

While the API is in flux, refer to `test.php` for example usage and the Random class itself under `lib`.

## composer install
 
```javascript 
"require": {
    "wind/random-compat" : "dev-master"
}
```
